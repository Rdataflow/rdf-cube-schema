# Relation vocabulary #

## Classes ##

The classes in the relation vocabulary are instances of meta:DimensionRelation as well as a rdfs:Class.
This facilitates validation of the Dimension Constraints

### relation:StandardError  {#StandardError}
 
 The standard error is the standard deviation of the mean of the sample.

#### relation:StandardError1SD {#StandardError1SD}

 The standard error is the standard deviation of the mean of the sample.

#### relation:StandardError2SD {#StandardError2SD}
 The standard error is 2 standard deviation of the mean of the sample.

#### relation:StandardError3SD {#StandardError3SD}
The standard error is 3 standard deviation of the mean of the sample.

### relation:StandardDeviation {#StandardDeviation}
 
 Dispersion of the values of a random variable around its expected value.

### relation:MarginOfError {#MarginOfError}
 
 The margin of error is the range of values below and above the sample statistic in a confidence interval.
 
#### relation:MarginOfErrorUpperBound {#MarginOfErrorUppoerBound}

  In case of asymmetric confidence intervals, the upper bound of the margin of error.
  
#### relation:MarginOfErrorLowerBound {#MarginOfErrorLowerBound}

  In case of asymmetric confidence intervals, the lower bound of the margin of error.
